Pi4J:   
    An object-oriented I/O API and implementation libraries for Java Programmers 
    to access the full I/O capabilities of the Raspberry Pi platform. This 
    project abstracts the low-level native integration and interrupt monitoring 
    to enable Java programmers to focus on implementing their application 
    business logic.

        The project was built on a Raspberry Pi 3B under raspian using the 
        pi4j-1.2-SNAPSHOT release.
    
    Using the installer, you can avoid having to add the libraries manually to
    the classpath.
